# I've developed a login and registration page. Users register first, and then a random OTP is generated and sent to the email address they provided during registration. After that, a verification page opens where users enter the OTP. If the OTP is correct, they are redirected to the login page; otherwise, an error message appears indicating an incorrect OTP.: Output
